Note-taking is an essential part of daily life, whether for personal reminders, brainstorming ideas, or organizing tasks. Traditional sticky notes, while convenient, can become disorganized, lost, or cluttered. With the rise of digital solutions, there is a growing need for an interactive and accessible note-taking application that allows users to efficiently manage their notes without the limitations of physical paper.
This project presents a web-based sticky note application that enables users to create, edit, and delete notes dynamically. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application offers a user-friendly interface with visually appealing sticky notes. Users can add new notes with a simple click, edit their content directly, and remove unwanted notes effortlessly. The responsive design ensures a smooth experience across different devices, enhancing accessibility and usability.
By leveraging web technologies, this application provides a lightweight and efficient alternative to traditional note-taking methods. Future enhancements, such as persistent storage using local databases, color customization, and drag-and-drop functionality, can further improve the user experience. This project aims to simplify digital note management while maintaining an intuitive and engaging interface.
